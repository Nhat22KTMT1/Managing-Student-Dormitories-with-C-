                                    --------------DORMITORY ENTRY/EXIT MANAGEMENT PROJECT--------------

Developed by:

1. INTRODUCTION
- This project is designed for dormitory management staff.

2. REQUIREMENTS
- Ensure that you have the latest version of C++ and a compatible compiler installed. Several popular IDEs include VS Code, DevC++, and Codeblocks; you may choose any one of these.

3. USAGE
- The system includes two modules: one for management staff and one for users (students).
a. Management Module:
Functions include adding students, removing students, viewing the student list, and checking entry/exit history. Additionally, administrators can change the username and password.

To access the management functions, log in with the default username quanlyktx1 and password 1111.

In the Add Student section, enter each student’s details: full name, date of birth, phone number, room number, and dormitory card number. This data is saved in a text file named “DSSV.txt.”
In the Remove Student section, enter the student’s dormitory card number, and the respective student’s information in “DSSV.txt” will be deleted.
b. User Module (for students):
This module includes two main functions: entering or exiting the dormitory. After selecting one of these options, students will provide details including full name, date of birth, phone number, room number, and dormitory card number. The system then displays the entered information along with the entry or exit timestamp in the format:

                                     Entry/Exit Time: Day of the Week, Month Date, Hour:Minute:Second, Year

- All data, including entry/exit times, is also saved in “lichsu.txt” so that management can review history records.
